Lets start our journey. FEEL allows you to use basic calculations like addition, substaction and multiplication to name a few. Camundonaut is starting the trip  
in Spain, specifically Madrid. Our friend wants to get to Pamplona (which is around 395.7 kms) and he will take a train that makes 3 hours and 7 minutes to get there.  
Using math, what is the average speed of the train? We want to be able to also round up the result.




```
// Speed = distance / time

"round up(400/3,0)"
```
