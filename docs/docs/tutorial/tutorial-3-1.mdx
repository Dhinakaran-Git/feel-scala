The next stop would put Zee in Cologne, as the journey continued there was an important question to answer: would Zee get in time for the conference?

The trip started on September 15th, 2022, and since the journey began, around 200 hours had passed. CamundaCon will start on October 5th, 2022. Consider the distance between Cologne and Berlin is 579 kms and as we already know, a walking average of 5 km/h.

Let's use numeric and temporal expressions to answer the question:

<LiveFeel
  defaultExpression={dedent`
    // Temporal function and period of time calculation
    date(startingDate) + duration("PT" + string(round up(200 + 579/5,0)) + "H")`}
    feelContext='{"startingDate": "2022-09-15", "targetDate": "2022-10-05"}'
  metadata={{ page: "tutorial-3-1" }}
/>

It looks like Zee will make it in time and arrive in Berlin on September 28th!!!
