Welcome to the documentation of the FEEL-Scala engine!

If you're **new** and don't know anything about FEEL then have a look
at [What is FEEL](./what-is-feel.md) first.

If you want to know how to **write** FEEL expressions then have a look at
the [Language Guide](./language-guide/language-guide-introduction.md).

If you want to **integrate** the FEEL engine in your application then have a look at
the [Developer Guide](./developer-guide/developer-guide-introduction.md).

If you want to **try out** your FEEL expressions in development then check out the
[Playground](/playground/playground.mdx) (online or local).
